-------------!!!OUTPUT OF THIS PROGRAM!!!-------------                             
n is a variable for user to insert positive integers.                           
Then n variable goes to th() function as a parameter.                       
===================================================================================
If n or user insert 1,the  output of the program is 1                           
********Your number that you just insert is >>n<<                               
===================================================================================
If n or user insert even number,the  output of the program                      
is lines of number that has been multiply by 3 and                                 
plus 1(n*3+1) and divided 2(n/2)                                             
****Your number that you just insert is >>n<<                                   
===================================================================================
If n or user insert odd number,the  output of the program                       
is lines of number that has been multiply by 3 and                                 
plus 1(n*3+1) and divided 2(n/2)                                            
****Your number that you just insert is >>n<<
